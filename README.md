PcComponentes-StyleFix
=================

Chrome Extension to fix the new (rather stupid) layout of pccomponentes.com

<br>
Overview
----
The new 2016 design layout for pccomponentes.com includes a 100px navigation bar stuck to the top of the window, that won't let you read anything without scrolling all the time.

This extension reduces the size of the navigation bar, making the web experience a lot better.
